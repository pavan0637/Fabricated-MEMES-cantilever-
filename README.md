This repository provides insights into the fabrication process of MEMS cantilevers using silicon nitride. MEMS cantilevers are critical components in micro- and nanoscale devices, widely used as sensors, actuators, and in nanomanipulation due to their excellent mechanical properties, high thermal conductivity, and chemical inertness.

Key Features:
Material: Silicon nitride for its robustness and performance.
Applications: Detection of temperature, pressure, or chemical changes; motion control as actuators.
Techniques Used: RCA cleaning, PVD silicon nitride deposition, optical lithography, reactive ion etching (RIE), and isotropic silicon etching.
Fabrication Steps:
RCA Cleaning: Removal of organic and metallic contaminants using chemical treatments.
Silicon Nitride Deposition: Thin-film deposition using Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD).
Optical Lithography: Pattern creation with UV light and photomasks.
Silicon Nitride Etching: Precise cantilever shaping via Reactive Ion Etching.
Isotropic Silicon Etching: Substrate removal to release the cantilever.
Photoresist Removal: Cleaning with solvents to finalize the structure.
Highlights:
Successfully fabricated silicon nitride MEMS cantilevers using advanced techniques.
SEM and AFM analysis confirmed excellent mechanical properties and surface quality.
Achieved precise control over dimensions and shape through anisotropic etching.
Isotropic etching effectively released cantilevers from the substrate.
Conclusion:
The fabrication process outlined here demonstrates a robust method for creating high-quality MEMS cantilevers, paving the way for their integration into complex systems in fields like sensing and actuation.
